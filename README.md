# P05-Treasure-Hunt-Adventure-Game
This assignment involves developing a treasure hunt style adventure game. This game will
include graphical elements that the user can click on, and can drag onto others to find clues,
solve puzzles and eventually win the game. The provided graphics and level file contain a
treasure hunt game set in a backyard. This can be an amazing adventure game for children.
The child must find a coin and place/drop it onto a target location showed in the map to
win.
The goals of this assignment include:
• Experience organizing code in an object oriented fashion that takes advantage of inheritance
relationships between your classes.
• Use of inheritance and interfaces to better organize your code in a more clear and concise
manner. Students should also enjoy the power of polymorphism.
• Learn how to use PApplet class defined in the processing graphic library directly to
develop a graphic application from the scratch, rather than through a provide .jar wrapper
file.
The source code can be found inside the 'P05/src' directory.
